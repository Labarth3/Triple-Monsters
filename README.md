🧩 Project Origin & Game Concept

Triple Monsters originated from the first online logic test of the 42 School selection process.

I decided to expand the idea into a fully playable game.
The project is a reinterpretation of the original exercise, with a strong focus on algorithmic logic, rule consistency, and iterative improvement.

🎮 Game Concept

The game is based on a simple but strict rule set:

Each move places a monster on the grid

When three monsters of the same level form:

a horizontal line

a vertical line

or a L-shaped pattern

All involved monsters are removed

The last placed monster evolves by one level

Multiple patterns can trigger at once, with no priority — all valid shapes are merged globally

The objective is to:

maximize the score

reach the highest possible monster level

before the grid is completely filled

This design encourages planning, anticipation, and strategic positioning, turning a simple mechanic into a deeper puzzle experience.
